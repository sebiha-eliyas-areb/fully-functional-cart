We're thrilled to have you on board for this project! This challenge is designed to test and improve your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's an excellent opportunity to put your knowledge into practice and create something truly impressive. Let's dive in!

## üöÄ The Challenge

- **Cart Management:** Allow users to increase/decrease item quantities and remove items from the cart.
- **Order Confirmation:** When users click "Confirm Order," display a confirmation modal.
- **Order Reset:** Users can reset their selections by clicking "Start New Order."
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the interface is optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Interactive States:** Implement hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

## üóÇ Where to Find Everything

- **Designs:** Located in the `/design` folder, including both mobile and desktop versions.
- **Assets:** All required images and icons are in the `/assets` folder, optimized for the correct screen sizes.
- **Fonts:** Variable and static font files are provided, or you can link to Google Fonts.
- **Style Guide:** Check out `style-guide.md` for color palettes, fonts, and other design guidelines.

## üí° Getting Started

Feel free to use any tools or workflows you're comfortable with. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **Setup Your Repository:**
   - Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - This will make it easier to share your code and get feedback.
   - Need help with Git? Check out [this resource](https://try.github.io/).

2. **Plan Your Work:**
   - Review the designs and plan your approach. Consider how you'll structure your HTML and CSS to keep your code organized and reusable.

3. **Start with HTML:**
   - Structure your content first, focusing on creating well-organized HTML before diving into styles.

4. **Apply Base Styles:**
   - Set up your global styles, such as `font-family`, `font-size`, and other basic elements.

5. **Style Section by Section:**
   - Begin styling from the top of the page and work your way down. Ensure each section is complete before moving to the next.
